h1. Module Nav

Module Nav is an EE2 accessory that makes two changes to EE2’s top navigation:

* Replaces the “Add-Ons” menu with a new “Modules” menu, populated with links to your modules’ CP backends
* Moves the old “Add-Ons” menu into the “Admin” menu, under “Add-on Administration”

h2. Installing Module Nav on ExpressionEngine 2.x

# Upload the module_nav folder to system/expressionengine/third_party/
# Install the accessory in Add-Ons → Accessories

Module Nav does *not* have its own accessory tab, so don’t worry when you don’t see it.
